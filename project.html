<h1>Leadership</h1>
<p>Current project manager is <a href="https://github.com/PiotrLegnica">Cat Plus Plus</a>.</p>

<h1>Project goals</h1>
<p>The primary goal is to create a FOSS replacement for <a href="http://chat.stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow Chat</a>.
The secondary goal is to create a reusable web multi-user chat solution based on XMPP.</p>
<p>The motivation for starting this project is twofold. First, many implemented features are plain broken,
as time and experience has proven:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The global community moderation (a.k.a. flagging) system does not work properly. Not in the sense
    that flagging does nothing, but in the sense that flagging is an extremely delayed response (unless
    we coordinate flagging, which is probably against the mighty rules) to an extremely time-sensitive
    situation. We've had cases of people getting banned for something said MONTHS ago, but we have trouble
    getting and keeping trolls annoying us RIGHT NOW out. It just doesn't fit.</li>
    <li>Room ownership is useless, and mostly for the show. They call us "owners", but we can't even
    enforce simple rules that ensure good chatting experience for the community. Oh but yeah, we can
    change the topic. And there's that nonsensical ability to move messages between rooms, that's used
    pretty much exclusively as a workaround for lack of ability to delete messages.</li>
    <li>Chat offers Markdown formatting, but in a reduced version, for no other reason than "we say you won't need that".</li>
    <li>Mobile interface is just ridiculously under-featured.</li>
    <li>Oneboxing (inlining external resources) has no opt-out, and sometimes disrupts the chat flow to the point of
    covering an entire discussion.</li>
    <li>Chat stores history, but the search engine is close to being useless.</li>
    <li>And the protocol is closed and undocumented, so we can't easily replace the client.</li>
</ul>
<p>And we get to the second reason: neglect. We (the chat users) have reported these, but the reports either get
no response, or are declined on the grounds of being incompatible with SO policies/vision for the chat. A vision
that's detached from reality and what users actually want. The ideal chat room would be full of mindless drones
droning about <i>insert technology we happened to include in the room title</i> 24/7.</p>
<p>All of these add up to chat experience that gets extremely tiresome and unpleasant. Thankfully, despite SO's best
efforts, we managed to form a community that transcends the technology. And that's how we arrive at Lounge&lt;Chat&gt;.</p>

<h1>Why XMPP?</h1>
<p>We've decided to use XMPP, because it's a standard, open protocol. There are many mature server and client implementations
we can leverage to reduce the amount of work needed to get this project going. And at the end, once we flesh out the details,
we hope to create a formal extension protocol, so that more clients and servers can be implemented with the chat features
we came to like so much.</p>

<h1 id="join">Joining the project</h1>
<p>We're currently based mostly around a GitHub organisation <a href="https://github.com/organizations/LoungeCPP">@LoungeCPP</a>.
Internal discussions happen on the original <a href="http://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/10/loungec">Lounge&lt;C++&gt;</a>.
To be added to @LoungeCPP:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Send a mail to <a href="mailto:piotrlegnica@piotrl.pl">piotrlegnica@piotrl.pl</a> with your GitHub username.</li>
    <li>Ping @CatPlusPlus in the chat.</li>
</ol>
<div class="alert alert-info">
    <strong>Important</strong>: use a valid mail account that you check regularily. I want to be able to send out
    organisatorial updates and stuff. You can opt out from the high-tech Manual Mailing List&trade; at any time.
</div>
<p>Note that non-regulars (i.e. if I don't recognise you) won't be added â€” you don't have to be part of the
organisation to contribute, though. Look at <a href="contributing.html">contribution guidelines</a> and start hacking away.</p>
